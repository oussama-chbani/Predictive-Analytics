## Introduction

### The situation: 
The World Health Organization has been generating significant press for a recent study on global life expectancy, and has asked me to conduct some statistical modeling and predictive analysis to better understand the data.



### The Brief: 
For this project, I have to apply predictive analytics tools in Tableau to ***explore trends***, ***build forecasts***, and ***conduct a cluster analysis*** using the ***[following](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)*** WHO life expectancy dataset.



### The Objective: 
Use Tableau Desktop to:
- Create trends to identify patterns in the data
- Leverage forecasts to project future data points
- Apply clustering to segment WHO data

## Predictive Analytics
Predictive Analytics is the practice of using statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and make predictions about future events or trends. It involves leveraging patterns and relationships within data to forecast outcomes, identify trends, and make informed decisions.

## Trend Line and Forecast:

In this project, the utilization of trend lines and forecasts serves as a pivotal tool for understanding and predicting life expectancy trends. A trend line, often depicted as a linear or non-linear line on a chart, helps visualize the direction and magnitude of changes over time. In the context of our analysis, we employed trend lines to observe the historical trajectory of life expectancy. The linear trend line with an R-squared value of 0.851845 and a significant p-value of < 0.0001 demonstrates that the life expectancy trends exhibit a strong linear pattern, implying that life expectancy in Germany is steadily improving over the years. The forecast model goes a step further, leveraging past data to predict future life expectancy values. By utilizing Tableau's forecasting capabilities, we can make informed decisions based on projected trends and anticipate how life expectancy may evolve in the coming years, aiding policymakers and healthcare professionals in planning for the future.

## Control Chart:

Control charts play a vital role in quality control and monitoring data variations over time. In our project, we employed control charts to assess the stability of life expectancy data for developed and developing countries. By incorporating distribution bands based on standard deviations, we were able to visualize variations within expected ranges. This allowed us to identify potential outliers and trends that may require further investigation. For instance, if a data point falls outside the established control limits, it could signal a noteworthy deviation from the norm, prompting a closer examination of the factors contributing to that deviation. The control chart feature in Tableau empowers us to continuously monitor and manage the quality of life expectancy data, ensuring that any unusual variations are promptly addressed and that data-driven decisions are based on reliable information.

## Cluster Analysis:

Cluster analysis is a valuable technique for grouping similar data points together based on shared characteristics, allowing us to gain deeper insights into data patterns. In our project, we applied cluster analysis to explore relationships between income composition of resources, life expectancy, and other dimensions. By leveraging Tableau's clustering capabilities, we uncovered distinct subpopulations within the data. This revealed hidden patterns and potential correlations that might not be immediately apparent through traditional data visualization alone. For instance, we can now identify groups of countries with similar income compositions and life expectancies, helping WHO to tailor interventions and policies for each cluster to improve overall life expectancy. The addition of a linear trend line within each cluster provides a visual representation of how these groups are evolving over time. This cluster analysis enhances our understanding of the underlying factors influencing life expectancy and facilitates more targeted decision-making to enhance global public health outcomes.
